## Reflections

1. Looking through your code, were you able to:
- Make use of Pure Functions?
- Make use of Higher Order Functions?
- Make use of Closures?
- Make use of Curried Functions?
- Make use of Composition?
2. How did you go about creating your data model? Where is it in your code?
3. How well were you able to separate your data model from the DOM logic? Where is that separation in the code?
